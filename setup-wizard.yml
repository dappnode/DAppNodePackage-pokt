      Upload an account using an Encrypted ASCII armored keyfile. You can create a new [keyfile/wallet here](https://wallet.pokt.network/) and then upload the generated keyfile.json here.
      Currently the Pocket Web Wallet allows for making these armored keyfiles needed to stake usisng a few methods, please use the keyfile option, if you use Ledger you cannot stake with that account, you can only hold coins not staked or as a cold wallet for holding non-custodial rewards in an offline wallet though it will matter more once we introduce non-custodial staking where you can stake only th minimum required stake while all rewards go to a controller address, which can be offline to keep from earning rewards in your hot wallet needed to Stake with Pokt(Make sure it's a custodial address, we do not yet have non custodial funtionality but it's on our short term roadmap along with allowing for LeanPocket use, a way to easily run multiple separate staked addresses on one machine and package using just a single Pocket Chain Instance) 
      Note: Please do not use a `$` or `!` in your passphrase because it may cause issues with the Pokt UI and will break the CLI.

      Note: Please do not use a `$` or `!` in your passphrase because it may cause issues with the Pokt UI and will break the CLI used in advanced troubleshooting (Doesn't make it impossible, but adds a step). If your wallet already created has these characters please change your keyfile passphrase by going [here](https://wallet.pokt.network/) input your wallet via its private key or the keyfile and its original password, once you've logged into your wallet via one of those 2 methods you can export the wallet as a keyfile and it will have you set a new keyfile password, be sure to make it compliant with these rules. Upload this keyfile to your node and enter the new compliant password to begin the app and click update.

      If you have limited disk space and cannot hold the full ~1TB Pokt chain or have issues downloading the chain snapshot due to disconnections from an unstable connection, etc., then you can download a pruned snapshot of the Pokt chain that currently is only ~60gb instead of ~1TB.
      Note: THIS PARAMETER CANNOT BE CHANGED once set initially during setup before snapshot download.  While you can technically change the setting to non-pruned after downloading the pruned snapshot, it will not work to relay as it's pruned down very heavily and if you enable fulll snapshot after downloading the pruned snapshot it will enable the ability to select Potk as a relay chain to stake in the Pokt UI but because it's not a full node it may possibly get your node penalties or which will a If you use a pruned snapshot you cannot relay the Pokt chain on your node since you only have the data needed to keep you verifying the chain but not storing any unessecary but realyed data. The app may automatically disable this option for you but if it doesn't just be sure not to enable relaying Pokt Mainnet Chain (0001) if you downloaded a pruned snapshot.

      If you have limited disk space, and do not have room for ~2TB to download and extract the full snapshot (as of Late December 2023 the full compressed snapshot download is over 730 GB and needs to be downloaded fully and then extracted, using an enormous amount of diskspace during the initial download and extraction but once it's done it will be only ~ 800GB total for the full (unpruned, read more on pruned snapshots below) Pokt Chain.  If you don't have the space for this, but have have enugh space for the ~1TB Pokt blockchain, you can attempt to use inline decompression, this saves from needing to have double the disk space, however if you dont have a very reliable high badwidth internet connection, this method will fail and need to be restarted from the beginning and cannot be restarted from where it left off, select `No` if you would like to try this way. 
      If you want to run a full node and have a lot of free space for install, select `Yes`.

      You can choose to download the snapshot file as a .tar archive, or as a compressed lz4.tar archive.  The lz4.tar archive is slightly smaller, but takes more system resources to decompress.  If you have a slower internet connection, or a fast node, and want to save download time and bandwidth, select `No`.

      You can choose to download the snapshot file from the default master server in the U.K. which is the default option and is best to select if installing on a Monday, new snapshots are uploaded once a week on Mondays at 00:00UTC, first released on the UK master server, then is copied to the slave mirrors in the U.S. and Japan.
      It's often best to leave this option as the default master domain which auto-selects the best mirror for your location), but on Mondays at 00:00UTC, the master server is updated first, and the slave mirrors are updated a few hours later, so if you are installing on a Monday, you may want to select `Yes` to use the U.K master server which will have the most up to date snapshot ready for download first before any of the other mirrors that would be auto-selected if you were not already in the Master UK zone anyway.
