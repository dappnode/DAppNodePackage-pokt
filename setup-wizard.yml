      Upload an account using an Encrypted ASCII armored keyfile. You can create a new [keyfile/wallet here](https://wallet.pokt.network/) and then upload the generated keyfile.json here.
      Currently the Pocket Web Wallet allows for making these armored keyfiles needed to stake usisng a few methods, please use the keyfile option, if you use Ledger you cannot stake with that account (currently at least, when we add non-custodial staking and the new staking method a ledger wallet can be used to delegate funds to a StakeNew node, or stake non-custodially, we do not yet have non-custodial or StakeNew funtionality enabled but it's on our short term roadmap along with allowing for LeanPocket, a way to run multiple servicers on one Pokt Node).

      Note: If you get errors in the logs while starting up that keeps the logs in a loop, or if you get errors while attempting to stake/re-stake, unjail, unstake, or sign messages, there may be an issue with your chosen passphrase. There have been issues in the past where certain special characters such as `$`, `!`, and some other more obscure special characters in your passphrase may cause issues with the Pokt UI may break the CLI used in our backend.
      Please reach out to Dappnode support on Discord if you have issues like this, as we discovvered the root of the issue and beleive we have resolved this issue, though we havent tested every edge case, so please contact support if you have an issue with your passphrase.

      If you have limited disk space and cannot hold the full ~1.6TB Pokt chain or have issues downloading the chain snapshot due to disconnections from an unstable connection, etc., then you can download a pruned snapshot of the Pokt chain that currently is only ~80GB instead of ~1.6TB.
      Note: THIS PARAMETER CANNOT BE CHANGED once set initially during setup, before the snapshot download begins.  While you can technically change the setting to non-pruned after downloading the pruned snapshot, it will not work to relay as the Pokt chain is pruned down very heavily and if you enable full snapshot after downloading the pruned snapshot it may enable the ability to select Pokt as a relay chain to stake in the Pokt UI but because it's not nearly a full node it may possibly result in penalties for your node or if you choose to use a pruned snapshot to relay that you cannot relay the full Pokt chain on your node since you only have the pruned data needed to keep you verifying the chain but not storing any (technically and normally not needed data: Historical Transactions, Historical states, and Historical blocks, etc.). This app does not yet but shortly will automatically disable this option for you but if it doesn't just be sure not to enable relaying/staking the Pokt Mainnet Chain (0001) if you downloaded a pruned snapshot, or pruned your own chain.

      If you have limited disk space, and do not have room for ~3.5TB to download and extract the full snapshot seprately (as of Early November 2024 the full compressed snapshot download is over 1.23TB and needs to be downloaded fully and then extracted, using an enormous amount of diskspace (Double ~3.5TB) during the initial download and extraction but once it's done it will be only ~1.3TB total for the full (unpruned, read more on pruned snapshots below) Pokt Chain.  If you don't have the space for this, but have have enugh space for the ~1.6TB Pokt blockchain, you can attempt to use inline decompression, this saves from needing to have double the disk space, however if you dont have a very reliable high badwidth internet connection, this method may fail and need to be restarted from the beginning and cannot be restarted from where it left off, select `No` if you would like to try this way. 
      If you want to run a full node and have a lot of free space for install, select `Yes`.

      You can choose to download the snapshot file from the default master server in the U.K. which is the default option and is best to select if installing on a Monday, new snapshots are uploaded once a week on Mondays at 00:00UTC, first released on the UK master server, then is copied to the slave mirrors in the U.S. and Japan.
      It's often best to leave this option as the default master domain which auto-selects the best mirror for your location), but on Mondays at 00:00UTC, the master server is updated first, and the slave mirrors are updated a few hours later, so if you are installing on a Monday, you may want to select `Yes` to use the U.K master server which will have the most up to date snapshot ready for download first before any of the other mirrors that would be auto-selected if you were not already in the Master UK zone anyway.

      Backfire Prevention is an advanced option to attempt to prevent your node from processing claims that may result in a reward lower than the cost of the claim.
      Leave this setting as `false` if you do NOT want to enable backfire prevention, which is the default Pokt setting.
      By setting this value to `true`, you are allowing your node to prevent claims that may result in a reward lower than the cost of the claim, which is 0.01 POKT (10,000 uPOKT) currently.
      Note: This is not an exact setting as the claim reward value is an estimate until the proof is submitted, so this setting may not be 100% effective in preventing claims that may result in a reward lower than the cost of the claim.
      Also note that this setting may have a larger effect on nodes staked in the lowest bracket as they earn far less rewards than those in upper breackets, Also this setting may have a negative effect on your node's performance for chains with very little activity.
